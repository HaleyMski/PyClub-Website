> If you are doing this for the first time, it is likely that you will have an authentification error. If this happens, I suggest downloading the GitHub cli on you computer (similar to installing Git). Once installed, run `gh auth login` in your terminal and login with your GitHub account.

## Creating a pull request
- Head on over to the repository on GitHub where your project lives. For this example, it would be at https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/PyClub-Website. You'll see a banner indicating that your branch is one commit ahead.    - Click Contribute and then Open a pull request.
- Click Create pull request.
- GitHub will bring you to a page where you can enter a title and a description of your changes.
- Finally, click Create pull request.

At this point, you have made your contribution and your changes can be approved to merge with the main repository on GitHub
